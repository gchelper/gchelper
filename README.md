## What is this?

This document is meant to be a guide to highly qualified immigrant workers on US H1B visas that seek Green Card sponsorship. I've become tired with having to work and interview with companies, only to realize they have some rather regressive GC policies. It is rather frustrating to:

1) Obtain all the necessary qualifications required for an H1B visa
2) Obtain the Visa itself
3) Be a hardworking and productive worker

and still face difficulties with gettting a sponsorship
